# Historical populations by ethnicity in US and GB

Basic population stats by ethnicity in the US and GB. For the US, dates from 1610 to 2010. For Britain, a narrower historical range from 1951 to 2011.

Data are for use in conjunction with NovelTM work on starter corpora, one goal of which is to create examples balanced by historical demographics of the U.S. and U.K. Sources are cited in the code notebook.

## How to use the data

If you just want to consult the historical demographics, there are plots and tables for the U.K. (first), U.S. (second), and comparative total populations (third) in the notebook. To import the data for other purposes, use the CSV files generated by the code. Note that the CSVs contain percentage compositions by ethnicity (or nation) and decade. Population counts (rather than fractions) would be easy to export from the notebook, but that isn't done at the moment.
